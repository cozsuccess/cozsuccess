ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cozsuccess
Iâ€™m currently teaching my son computer basics and am working to stay one step ahead.
I won't be in very often as I'm just beginning my exploration of this space. 
It's been a LONG time since I was in the computer game. I know I've got alot to catch up on.
My initial education came from one who started when computers were run by punch cards and my first system was an 80-86, the first one I built was a 286.
I remember the upheaval of the name Pentium. ;) 
I laughed as we changed all the coding to recognize 4 digit year sequences rather that 2 digit and the media spun out the story that the world was ending.
The funniest thing to me is when someone says that in interface or colab can't be done between systems. Obviously an English major that snuck into a Math major space.
It will be interesting to see how deep the rabbit hole has gone.
